//! Surface wind: a diagnostic vector field recomputed each step from the current temperature
//! field and the planet's geometry. There is no momentum state — the wind is in instantaneous
//! balance with the climate, which is the right level of fidelity for an ecology model and keeps
//! the update cheap and unconditionally stable.
//!
//! The field is the sum of two parts:
//!
//!   1. **Tri-cell zonal-mean belts** (`belt_wind`). A single vertically-integrated layer cannot
//!      *produce* the Hadley/Ferrel/Polar overturning (that needs a vertical dimension), so the
//!      robust, well-understood belt structure is imposed analytically: easterly trades (0–30°),
//!      mid-latitude westerlies (30–60°), polar easterlies (60–90°), with a matching meridional
//!      surface branch (equatorward in the Hadley/Polar cells, poleward in the Ferrel cell) so the
//!      trades come out north*easterly* as on Earth. Crucially the belt *strength* is scaled by
//!      the **simulated** equator-to-pole temperature contrast (`gradient_factor`), so the winds
//!      strengthen and weaken with the climate and the seasons rather than being painted on.
//!
//!   2. **Geostrophic perturbation** (`geostrophic_wind`). The departures from the zonal mean —
//!      monsoon flow, continental highs and lows — come from the actual temperature field: treat
//!      cold air as high pressure, take the surface temperature gradient, and balance the
//!      pressure-gradient force against the Coriolis force (`f = 2Ω sinφ`, capped near the equator
//!      where geostrophy breaks down), with a friction term turning the flow partly across the
//!      isobars toward low pressure.
//!
//! Everything is a tangent vector to the unit sphere (perpendicular to the cell normal), in m·s⁻¹,
//! mirroring [`Terrain::velocity`](super::terrain::Terrain::velocity).
